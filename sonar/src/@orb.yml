  ## Sonar Static Code Analysis Orb

  This orb provides a reusable job to install the [SonarQube Scanner](https://docs.sonarsource.com/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/) and run static code analysis within your CircleCI pipeline.

  Supports configuration for both [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io) and self-hosted SonarQube, with options to set:
  
  - `project_key`
  - `organization`
  - `sources`
  - `exclusions`
  - `host_url`
  - `sonar_token` (as a secure environment variable)

  Easily integrate code quality and security checks into your workflow to enforce DevSecOps best practices.
